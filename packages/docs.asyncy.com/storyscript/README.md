# Storyscript

Storyscript is a syntax-light high-level programming language that **orchestrates microservices**.
Application logic is expressive and transparent by requiring **named arguments** in all functions and microservices.
Built-in **service discovery** provides a powerful environment for finding services and autocomplete to assist with inputs and outputs.

Storyscript (or Stories for short) focuses on the **application logic** rather than all the *tape and glue* that bind applications together. The underlining services have a standard for **logs, metrics, fail-over, rate-limiting, tracebacks and scaling** which eliminates the need to write it within the application. This cultivates a development environment primed for rapid application development in a production-ready platform.

Let's build a quick application for example. Our goals are to upload, analyze, compress and archive a video. A non-trivial application but in a **couple lines of Storyscript** we made it.

```coffeescript
# Registers with Asyncy Server as an endpoint
http-endpoint method:'post' path:'/upload' as request, response
    # generate a unique id for this upload
    id = uuid uuid4

    video = request.files.myUploadedVideo

    # using https://machinebox.io find the video topics
    topics = machinebox/videobox content:video

    if 'nudity' in details
        response finish code:400 message:'Sorry, nudity found in image.'
    else
        response finish code:201 message:'Success! Will process and store asynchronously.'

    # save record in mongodb
    mongodb insert db:'uploads' data:{'id': id, 'topics': topics}

    # using https://github.com/xiph/daala let's compress it to h264
    video = xiph/daala video:video codex:'h264'

    # upload to AWS S3
    s3 put target:'/video/{{id}}.mp4' data:video
```

In comparison, the same application would likely take **hundreds of lines of code**, not to mention that each service above includes metrics, logging and scaling out-of-the-box.

Time to jump into syntax.

## Syntax Overview

```coffeescript
###
Welcome!
  This is a comment block
###

# Strings
myString = "Hello"
stringWithPlaceholders = "Say {{string}}!"
# >>> Say Hello!

# Numbers
one = 1
onethree = 1.3

# Boolean
foo = true
bar = false

# List
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
letters[0]
# >>> 1

# Object
fruit = {'apple': 'red', 'banana': 'yellow'}
fruit.apple
# >>> red

# Regexp
pattern = /^foobar$/

# files
path = `/folder/name.ext`

# Null
empty = null

# Conditions
if one > 1
    # then do this
else if one == 1
    # then do this
else
    # do this

# Loops
for child in siblings
    # ...

foreach siblings as child
    # ...

while foobar
    # ...

# Services
output = service cmd key:value

# Functions
function walk distance:number -> someOutput:sting
    # ...
    return "Ok, walked {{distance}}km!"

walk distance:10
# >>> Ok, walked 10km!
walk distance:6.1
# >>> Ok, walked 6.1km!

# Chaining calls
myService cmd foo:(myString split by:',')
              bar:(myObject find key:(myList random))
```


## Strings

```coffeescript
data = "foobar"

long_string = "Hi Friend,
This is a long string."
# >>> "Hi Friend, This is a long string."

more_data = """
    The quick brown fox
    jumps over the lazy dog.
"""
# >>> The quick brown fox\njumps over the lazy dog.

where = "Earth"
data_formatted = "Hello, {{where}}"
# >>> "Hello, Earth"
```

Like many traditional programming languages, Storyscript supports strings as delimited by the `"` or `'` characters.
Storyscript also supports string interpolation within "-quoted strings, using `{{ variable }}`.
Single-quoted strings are literal. You may even use interpolation in object keys.

Multiline strings are allowed in Storyscript.
Lines are joined by a single space unless they end with a backslash.
Indentation is ignored.

Block strings, delimited by `"""` or `'''`, can be used to hold formatted or indentation-sensitive text (or, if you just donâ€™t feel like escaping quotes and apostrophes).
The indentation level that begins the block is maintained throughout, so you can keep it all aligned with the body of your code.

Double-quoted block strings, like other double-quoted strings, allow interpolation.

### Mutations

```shell
"abc" length
# >>> 3

"abc" replace before:'b' after:'Z'
# >>> aZc

"foo bar" capitalize
# >>> Foo Bar

"a,b,c" split by:','
# >>> ['a', 'b', 'c']

"abc" upper
# >>> ABC

"ABC" lower
# >>> abc
```

## Numbers

```coffeescript
int = 1
number = 1.2
```


## Comments

```coffeescript
###
Large
  Comment
Block
####

# Inline comment

foo = "bar"  # end of line comment
```

In Storyscript, comments are denoted by the `#` character to the end of a line,
or from `###` to the next appearance of `###`.
Comments are ignored by the compiler, though the compiler makes its best effort at reinserting your comments into the output JavaScript after compilation.


## Boolean

```coffeescript
foo = true
bar = no
```

## Lists

```coffeescript
list_inline = [string, 1, 2]
list_multiline = [
  string,
  1,
  2
]
```

### Mutations

```python
['a', 'b', 'c'] length
# >>> 3

['a', 'b', 'c'] join by:','
# >>> a,b,c

['a', 'b', 'c'] reverse
# >>> ['c', 'b', 'a']

['a', 'b', 'c'] shift from:'left'
# >>> a
# the list becomes ['b', 'c']

['a', 'b', 'c'] index of:'b'
# >>> 1

['1', '2', '3'] apply function:Int
# >>> [1, 2, 3]

['a', 'b', 'c'] random
# randomly choose >>> a
```

## Objects

```coffeescript
object_inline = {'foo': 'bar', 'apples': 'oranges'}
object_multiline = {
  'foo': 'bar',
  'apples': 'oranges'
}
```

### Mutations

```python
{'a': 1, 'b': 2} length
# >>> 2

{'a': 1, 'b': 2} keys
# >>> ['a', 'b']

{'a': 1, 'b': 2} values
# >>> [1, 2]

{'a': 1, 'b': 2} items
# >>> [['a', 1], ['b', 2]]

{'a': 1, 'b': 2} pop key:'a'
# >>> 1
# resulting object = {'b': 2}
```


## Conditions

```coffeescript
if foo = bar
  # ...
else if foo > bar
  # ...
else
  # ...

if (foo > 0 or cat is not dog) or foobar like /regexp/
  # ...
```

`if`/`else` statements can be written without the use of parentheses and curly brackets. As with functions and other block expressions, multi-line conditionals are delimited by indentation.

## Looping

```coffeescript
for child in siblings
  # ...

foreach siblings as child
  # ...

while foobar
  # ...
```

In Storyscript, loops provide a way to iterate over data.

## Services

```coffeescript
# Service with command and arguments
service cmd key:value anotherKey:value

# Service without command and assigned to variable
output = service key:value
                 anotherKey:value

# Streaming service
service dothis key:value as data
    # ...
```

In Storyscript, the syntax to run a service appears natural and arguments are named for transparency.
Arguments may by indented in a new line.

## More coming soon...

More exciting features are coming soon:

1. Built-in cron/waiting
2. Asynchronous primitives
