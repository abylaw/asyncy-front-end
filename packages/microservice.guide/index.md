## Why Microservice.Guide

Microservices, by design, are intended to be highly reusable, operational specific and language-agnostic.
However, there is no standard that defines how to interface with microservices that provide a blueprint for consistency and reusability. Microservice.Guide intends to define standards of how to configure microservices so they are
well documented, portable between platforms while not restricting any functionality that containerization provides.


## Using Microservice.Guide

Below are products and companies that uphold the standards defined in Microservice.Guide.
