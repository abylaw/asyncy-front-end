## Why Microservice.guide

Microservices, by design, are intended to be highly reusable, operational specific and language-agnostic.
However, there is no standard defined for interfacing with microservices that is platform-agnostic.
Microservice.guide intends to define standards of how to design and configure microservices so they are
well documented, portable between platforms while not restricting any functionality that containerization provides.
